# What is JavaScript?

<a name="javascript-overview"></a>

JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for adding interactivity to web pages. It operates as an interpreted language, executing code line by line without prior compilation.

## Historical Context

JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was at Netscape Communications Corporation. Originally named "Mocha" and later "LiveScript," it was rebranded as JavaScript to align with the popularity of Java.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Typing:** Variables can hold values of any data type without explicit declarations.
  
- **Prototype-based Object Orientation:** Objects inherit properties and behaviors from prototypes.

- **Functional Programming Support:** Functions are treated as first-class citizens, enabling higher-order functions and closures.

# Where can I use JavaScript?

<a name="usage"></a>

JavaScript can be used for both client-side and server-side development. It's integral to creating interactive web pages, developing web and mobile applications, building APIs, and even for server-side programming using platforms like Node.js.

# Which libraries and frameworks are built in JavaScript?

<a name="libraries-frameworks"></a>

JavaScript has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that simplify and enhance development. Some popular examples include:

- **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  
- **AngularJS and Angular:** Frameworks for building web applications.

- **Node.js:** A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run server-side.

These tools and frameworks extend JavaScript's capabilities beyond basic scripting, enabling robust application development across various platforms.
